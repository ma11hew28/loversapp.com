# Lovers

## Share the Love.

[Lovers][1] lets you share your love for your friends.

The mission of Lovers is to inspire everyone to express their love for each other. The concept is simple: Ask yourself who you love, select one of your friends, and click the Share button. The Love action, e.g., "Matt Di Pasquale loves Sara Hamilton," appears on your profile, under your "Recent Activity."

Even just a simple act of kindness, love, or gratitude can go a long way.
