### Lovers Visitors

#### Traffic Analysis

Lovers monitors traffic to its [canvas page][1] with [Google Analytics][2]. Some of the data that Google Analytics tracks are: referral URLs, number of page views, approximate geographic locations of visitors, etc. These statistics, however, are completely anonymous.

### Lovers Users

#### Lovers Fan List

On the [Lovers canvas page][1], Lovers displays the [Facepile Social Plugin][3] created by Facebook. Facebook also displays, on the [Lovers page][4], a sampling of those who've "liked" Lovers. Facebook also shares this information as usual, like on the News Feed or Live Feed.

#### Sending Love to Friends

From a privacy perspective, sending love to a friend via Lovers is similar to sending a wall post to a friend. Facebook stores these wall posts for Lovers.

#### Sending Gifts to Friends

Lovers uses [Redis to Go][5] through [Heroku][6] to store the set of all Lovers User ids and all sent & received gifts for every user.
