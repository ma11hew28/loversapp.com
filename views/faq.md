- ### How does the leaderboard work?

    Those user who send the most gifts we call the "Most Loving," and those who receive the most gifts we call the "Most Loved." We use the following point system.
    
    Note: The sender & receiver always earn the same amount of points.
    Note: Only actions taken after February 14th, 3pm EST have been awarded points.
    
    - Red Heart: 1 points
    - Red Rose:  11 points
    - Dozen Roses: 100 points
    - Blue Diamond: 3305 points

- ### How do I update my status with a little heart at the end?

    You can post to your wall with a little heart by just clicking "Share" from the [canvas page](/) without entering a friend's name first. It doesn't update your status. We'll add a feature to do that if you [ask us to][1].


- ### How do I add my friends as lovers?

    This feature is coming soon.
