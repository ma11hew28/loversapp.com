Seeking Pair to Develop Facebook App ($15/hr)

Hi,

Do you want to continue to master building web (Facebook/Twitter) applications with the latest, cutting-edge technology?

Do you want to be one of two lead developers on an Awesome, Popular application?

Do you LOVE collaborating, learning, and [programming in pairs][1]?

If you answered YES to the three questions above, then keep reading...

Two years ago, I developed a Facebook application called [Lovers][2] in an independent study in Internet Technologies under Professor Margo Seltzer.

It reached over 

I'm looking for two computer programmers to pair with on a new version of a Facebook app called [Lovers][2], which currently has almost 1 million users and [over 275,000 likes][3].

This is an opportunity for you to gain valuable experience & training with a cutting-edge web & mobile developer and to learn how to build Facebook apps, using the latest technologies.

I graduated Harvard '09 in CS and now work full-time as a [Ruby on Rails][4] developer. I can meet with you at Yale to work on the weekends. I could even come today, but I'll be in NYC tomorrow.

We'll be implementing common Facebook app functionalities. You could even use these implementations in your other web apps. Some of these functionalities include:

  - [Authenticating users][5] with [Facebook's JS SDK][6] and the [signed_request][7] parameter
  - Accessing Facebook user information with the [Graph API][8] &amp; [FQL][9]
  - Posting love to a friend's wall with [Facebook dialogs][10]
  - Sending relationship [requests to friends with FBML][11], which is being deprecated but is currently the only option to send requests
    - Storing these sets of requests &amp; relationships in [Redis][12], great for set operations
  - Implementing a Valentine's Day gift system with [Facebok's Credits API][13] e-commerce solution
  - Awarding users points &amp; badges (stored in Redis) and displaying leadership boards

Here are some other technologies I'm using that you'll gain experience with:

Front-end:

  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  - Adobe Photoshop &amp; Illustrator (and 99Designs.com)
  - [jQuery][14], AJAX, JSON
  - [ERB][15]

Back-end:

  - [Ruby][16], [Sinatra][17], [JSON RESTful API][18], [YAML][19]

Free Hosting:

  - [Heroku][20], [Redis To Go][21]

Behavior-Driven Development:

  - [Cucumber][22] &amp; [RSpec][23]

Preferred Development Environment:

  - Mac OSX 10.6, [MacVim][24], or [TextMate][25], or whatever you prefer for when you drive.

I'm working on the [new version of the app][26] for this Valentine's Day.

I'm looking for someone who really wants to learn this stuff and build cool apps.

Compensation to be decided.
